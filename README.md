# Cat Vs Dog Classification

This repository contains a solution for the classic **Dog vs Cat Classification** problem using deep learning techniques. The goal is to classify images of dogs and cats with high accuracy using **TensorFlow** and **Keras**.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is publicly available on Kaggle: [Dogs vs Cats](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/salader/dogs-vs-cats/data). The dataset contains labeled images of dogs and cats, which were preprocessed and used for training and evaluation.

## Model Architecture
The model is built using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** and includes the following key components:

- **Convolutional Layers** to extract spatial features from images.
- **MaxPooling2D** layers to reduce spatial dimensions and prevent overfitting.
- **Fully Connected Layers** for classification.

### Key Technologies Used
- **TensorFlow**: For building and training the deep learning model.
- **Keras**: High-level API for TensorFlow to design and implement the CNN architecture.

### Model Performance
The model achieved an impressive accuracy of **97.37%** on the validation dataset.

## How to Use
### Prerequisites
- Python (>= 3.8)
- TensorFlow (>= 2.9)
- Kaggle API (for downloading the dataset)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/dog-vs-cat-classification.git
   cd dog-vs-cat-classification
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Download the dataset from Kaggle:
   ```bash
   kaggle datasets download -d salader/dogs-vs-cats -p data/
   unzip data/dogs-vs-cats.zip -d data/
   ```


## Results
The model achieved a validation accuracy of **97.37%**, demonstrating effective performance in distinguishing between images of dogs and cats.

## Future Improvements
- Experiment with data augmentation to further improve generalization.
- Use transfer learning with pretrained models like VGG16 or ResNet50.
- Implement real-time image classification using a web or mobile app.

## Acknowledgments
- Kaggle for providing the dataset.
- TensorFlow and Keras teams for the amazing libraries.
